//3. Write a JavaScript program to sort the elements of a given stack in ascending order.



//4. Write a JavaScript program to reverse the elements of a given stack.



//5. Write a JavaScript program to find the maximum and minimum elements in a stack.



//6. Write a JavaScript program to remove all elements from a given stack.



//7. Write a JavaScript program to count all the elements in a given stack.



//8. Write a JavaScript program to implement a stack that checks if a given element is present or not in the stack.



//9. Write a JavaScript program to remove duplicates from a given stack.

//12. Write a JavaScript program to rotate the stack elements to the right direction.



//13. Write a JavaScript program to get the middle element(s) of a given stack.



//14. Write a JavaScript program to remove a specific element from a stack.



//15. Write a JavaScript program to swap the top two elements of a given stack.



//16. Write a JavaScript program to get the nth element from the top of the stack.



//17. Write a JavaScript program to get the nth element from the bottom of the stack.



//18. Write a JavaScript program to implement a stack and move the nth element from the top of the stack to the top.



//19. Write a JavaScript program to implement a stack and move the nth element from the bottom of the stack to the top.



//20. Write a JavaScript program to merge two stacks into one.



//21. Write a JavaScript program to implement a stack using a linked list with push and pop operations. Find the top element of the stack and check if the stack is empty or not.


//22. Write a JavaScript program to implement a stack that supports toArray() operation, which converts the stack into an array.



//23. Write a JavaScript program that can create stacks from arrays.



//24. Write a JavaScript program to implement a stack that supports concat() operation, which concatenates two stacks into a new stack.



//25. Write a JavaScript program to implement a stack that creates a copy of the stack.



//26. Write a JavaScript program that implements a stack and checks if a stack is a subset of another stack.



//27. Write a JavaScript program that implements a stack and checks if two stacks are equal.



//28. Write a JavaScript program that implements a stack and finds elements that are common in two stacks..



//29. Write a JavaScript program that implements a stack and find elements that are in the first stack but not in the second stack.



//30. Write a JavaScript program that implements a stack and creates a new stack that contains all elements from both stacks without duplicates.



//31. Write a JavaScript program that implements a stack and creates a new stack that contains only elements that are in either the first or the second stack, but not in both.



//32. Write a JavaScript program that implements a stack and creates a new stack from a portion of the original stack.



//33. Write a JavaScript program that implements a stack and checks if all elements of the stack satisfy a condition.



//34. Write a JavaScript program that implements a stack and checks if at least one element of the stack satisfies a condition.


//35. Write a JavaScript program that implements a stack and create a new stack by removing elements that do not satisfy a condition.
