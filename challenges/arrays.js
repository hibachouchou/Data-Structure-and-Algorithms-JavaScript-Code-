// JavaScript Arrays - Exercises

//1. Write a JavaScript function to check whether an `input` is an array or not.

//2. Write a JavaScript function to clone an array.

/* 3. Write a JavaScript function to get the first element of an array. 
Passing the parameter 'n' will return the first 'n' elements of the array.*/

/*4. Write a JavaScript function to get the last element of an array. 
Passing the parameter 'n' will return the last 'n' elements of the array.*/

//5. Write a simple JavaScript program to join all elements of the following array into a string.

/*6. Write a JavaScript program that accepts a number as input and inserts dashes (-) between each even number. 
For example if you accept 025468 the output should be 0-254-6-8. */

//7. Write a JavaScript program to sort the items of an array.

//8. Write a JavaScript program to find the most frequent item in an array.

/*9. Write a JavaScript program that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. 
For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'. */

/*10. Write a JavaScript program that prints the elements of the following array.
Note : Use nested for loops.
Sample array : var a = [[1, 2, 1, 24], [8, 11, 9, 4], [7, 0, 7, 27], [7, 4, 28, 14], [3, 10, 26, 7]];
Sample Output :
"row 0"
" 1"
" 2"
" 1"
" 24"
"row 1"
